# USDX-CNTRL-MCU

This project are in attempt to integrate USDX version from WB2CBA with the following features:

01 - 6 bands LPF selection.

02 - RF power amplifier (RFPA) controlling process, since it is crucial for the proper transition sequence.

03 - SWR measurements, with a simplified LED indicator - 1->1.5 (BEST), 1.5->1.9 (BETTER), 1.9->3 (GOOD), >3 (POOR).

04 - Spectrum display experimentation.

Below are the first prototype image:
